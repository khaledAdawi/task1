<p> I'm khaled , I'm in my second year of studying computer science at Birzeit University, and I'm really excited about the journey ahead. Coding has always fascinated me, and I’m especially looking forward to diving deeper into full-stack development. I know there's a lot to learn, but I'm committed to improving my skills and tackling new challenges. I can’t wait to see how I can apply what I learn to create innovative solutions and projects in the tech world! </p>
